Hello, my name is Korben, I'm 19 years old from Queensland, Australia. I completed grade 12 of high school in 2019. I can speak a small bit of Japanese as a result of the Japanese classes I took throughout high school and in 2017 I attended a school trip to Japan in which we learnt alot about the culture and the people there, including many things to do with IT and their technological advancements. 

### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
I have had an interest in IT for most of my life as I have used computers and other electronic devices since I was very young. This was most influenced by my Dad who introduced me to video games and gave me his old computer to use when I was only about 8 years old. My main interest in IT would be to understand how programs function and how to make my own programs, I hope to take this experience into a further degree in Game Design. 

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose RMIT as among other universities available to me through Open University, it was the most centered around Technology and the idea of creation. I really wanted something more focused on what my interests are and I found RMIT to be the university that would best fulfill that for me. 

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I expect to learn many new things about technology during my studies such as how devices and systems relating to them function, how code can be used to instruct a device and how you can create so many new things right from your desk at home. Through this IT unit specifically I hope to learn how to better express myself in this field and how to work better with teams and peers with the same or similar interests to my own.

## Ideal Job

My ideal job would be in the game development industry, games have always been a big part of my life and I hope to one day work towards making them myself.

This Game Developer job at GMT People is an example of an ideal job I am aiming to have one day.

This position involves using the Unity engine (a game developing engine) and code languages such as Javascript, CSS and HTML to design and develop 3D games. This position is of particular interest to me as it perfectly outlines what I am looking for in my ideal job, using tools alongside my own imagination and experience to create new games and more.

The skills and qualifications required for this position include and understanding of game design principles and the ability to apply them to 2D/3D games, an ability to create and execute a plan with softward products, an understanding of the difference code languages listed above and how to write and use them as well as knowledge of how to use other useful software such as Photoshop and other graphic design products. 

My personal skills and qualifications do not reach those required for this position currently. I currently only have very little understanding of code languages in general and even less so in the particular 3 languages required for this job. I also do not have any experience using the Unity engine or much experience with graphic design products like Photoshop. 

My plan to obtain these skills and qualifications for this job would be to continue studying and learning new things through my current IT Degree. In programming classes I will learn more about coding and the specific languages involved in it such as Javascript and CSS. I will also begin using software like the Unity engine and Photoshop more in my personal time to better understand how they work and how to create new projects with them. After my IT Degree is finished my goal is to go into a Game Design Degree to further hone my knowledge and learn more specific skills relating to this career.

These results show me that I tend to learn some things slower then other might and it is easier for me to be visually shown how something works then to read and interpret the information myself. It also shows that I try to avoid issues in alot of cases for as long as I can instead of tackling them head on and solving them as fast as possible. I am also not a leader and I tend to prefer taking a more backseat role in a group and work independently. 

This may influence my ability to work in a group and my behaviour in a group quite drastically. I will try to let others make the decisions for me and tell me what part of the work i have to do and if any issues or problems arise I will try to avoid being the one to fix them. I prefer working on my own and if I were to work in a group I would try to do smth in for the group that still involves working by myself.

When forming a team, taking into account the results from my tests I would try to work with people who do not share the same anti-social characteristics I do. If i can form a team made up of people I find to be friends and who can help me feel more comfortable and who are very social amongst themselves it would be much easier for myself to be more involved and perhaps eliminate some of the personal issues I have with working in groups.
