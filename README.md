Hello, my name is Korben, I'm 19 years old from Queensland, Australia. I completed grade 12 of high school in 2019. I can speak a small bit of Japanese as a result of the Japanese classes I took throughout high school and in 2017 I attended a school trip to Japan in which we learnt alot about the culture and the people there, including many things to do with IT and their technological advancements. 

### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
I have had an interest in IT for most of my life as I have used computers and other electronic devices since I was very young. This was most influenced by my Dad who introduced me to video games and gave me his old computer to use when I was only about 8 years old. My main interest in IT would be to understand how programs function and how to make my own programs, I hope to take this experience into a further degree in Game Design. 

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose RMIT as among other universities available to me through Open University, it was the most centered around Technology and the idea of creation. I really wanted something more focused on what my interests are and I found RMIT to be the university that would best fulfill that for me. 

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I expect to learn many new things about technology during my studies such as how devices and systems relating to them function, how code can be used to instruct a device and how you can create so many new things right from your desk at home. Through this IT unit specifically I hope to learn how to better express myself in this field and how to work better with teams and peers with the same or similar interests to my own.

  ## Ideal Job
My ideal job would be in the game development industry, games have always been a big part of my life and I hope to one day work towards making them myself.
This Game Developer job at GMT People is an example of an ideal job I am aiming to have one day.
